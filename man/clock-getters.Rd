\description{
This family of functions extract fields from a calendar vector. Each
calendar has its own set of supported getters, which are documented on
their own help page:
\itemize{
\item \link[=year-month-day-getters]{year-month-day}
\item \link[=year-month-weekday-getters]{year-month-weekday}
\item \link[=year-week-day-getters]{year-week-day}
\item \link[=iso-year-week-day-getters]{iso-year-week-day}
\item \link[=year-quarter-day-getters]{year-quarter-day}
\item \link[=year-day-getters]{year-day}
}

There are also convenience methods for extracting certain components
directly from R's native date and date-time types.
\itemize{
\item \link[=Date-getters]{dates (Date)}
\item \link[=posixt-getters]{date-times (POSIXct / POSIXlt)}
}
}
\details{
You cannot extract components directly from a time point type, such as
sys-time or naive-time. Convert it to a calendar type first. Similarly,
a zoned-time must be converted to either a sys-time or naive-time, and
then to a calendar type, to be able to extract components from it.

x <- year_month_day(2019, 1:3, 5:7, 1, 20, 30)
