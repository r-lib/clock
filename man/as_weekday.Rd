\description{
\code{as_weekday()} converts to a weekday type. This is normally useful for
converting to a weekday from a sys-time or naive-time. You can use this
function along with the \emph{circular arithmetic} that weekday implements to
easily get to the "next Monday" or "previous Sunday".

\examples{
x <- as_naive_time(year_month_day(2019, 01, 05))

# This is a Saturday!
as_weekday(x)

# See the examples in `?weekday` for more usage.
}
