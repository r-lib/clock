# CXX11 is required, apparently CXX14 would be better for constexpr support

# -DINSTALL=dummy
# To keep some problematic code from running on windows if INSTALL isn't defined.
# We overwrite the install location in the `.onLoad()`, so this really isn't meaningful.

# -DAUTO_DOWNLOAD=0
# -DHAS_REMOTE_API=0
# These are required to turn off code that links against libcurl.
# We embed our own time zone database directly so we don't need any of this.

# -DUSE_OS_TZDB=0
#
# Using the time zone data base that comes with the OS can be MUCH faster
# because it is pre-compiled. However, there are a few issues.
#
# On Mac, the date library doesn't "extend" out time zone info for large dates:
# https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date/issues/563
#
# On Windows, can't directly specify the TZDIR yet, although this might change:
# https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date/issues/564
# https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date/pull/611
#
# Because of these issues, we instead default to using an uncompressed
# text version of the tzdb that we ship with this package.
