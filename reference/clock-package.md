# clock: Date-Time Types and Tools

Provides a comprehensive library for date-time manipulations using a new
family of orthogonal date-time classes (durations, time points,
zoned-times, and calendars) that partition responsibilities so that the
complexities of time zones are only considered when they are really
needed. Capabilities include: date-time parsing, formatting, arithmetic,
extraction and updating of components, and rounding.
