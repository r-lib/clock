Great specifying holidays. year-day: alternative way specify Gregorian date year day year. Great extracting day year, grouping day year. year-quarter-day: Great quarterly financial data, fiscal year starts different month January. year-week-day: Allows specify date using year, week number, day week, start value representing day represents start week. iso-year-week-day: Follows ISO week standard.
